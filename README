********** General Information **********
This software is intended to provide a general method for extracting 
information from root files created via the ddasdumper program. 
Currently, the only tested version of the ddasdumper is v2.0. 

In addition, this program requires linking against a version of ROOT, 
and uses standard ROOT libraries/headers. The current tested versions 
of root are 5.34.14a and 5.34.14 (available under the module lists in 
fishtank).

Finally, this code uses some source files from the pixie_scan program. 
This program was developed at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, 
and has been modified by the author for the current needs. These parts of 
the source may not be redistributed without the accompnaying header and 
are licensed under the GNU GPL v3. 

********** Usage **********
In order to use the program, one needs to point the Makefile to the user's
installation of the ddasdumper program. 

The user should then setup a "map.txt" file in the src directory. 
This file lets the program know what detector type it has, as well as 
what channels of Pixie those detectors were plugged into. 

Running the file requires both input and output files. There may be multiple 
input files defined; however only one output file is recognized. All of the 
input files will be scanned into a single output file. 

> he6scan <inputFile(s)> <outputFile>

********** Other Files **********
Other files are included as my attempts to learn ROOT, and perform various 
handy functions. A quick break down follows; 

run.bash : A bash script to run multiple runs in batch mode.

src/fitDky.gp : A gnuplot script to fit the decay curve.

src/PlotHistogram.C : An attempt to plot specific histograms from the output.

src/ProjectNSub.C : Performs projections of the Time vs. Energy spectra and 
                    does the background subtraction before plotting.

src/SaveEps.C : Saves the various histograms to eps and jpg (only 2d) files. 

src/Simp.C : A macro version of the compiled code. The user should point the
             script to the proper location of the ddasdumper code and ensure 
             the ddasdumper has been compiled with the same version of ROOT.
