# New version of map file
# subtype, location, and tags can be omitted
# module and channel designations may contain:
#   *   to indicate all unused possibilites
#   m-n to indicate a range from m to n
#   e,o to indicate even or odd channels
# Wildcard lines are processed AFTER all single channel designations
# One channel in final module MUST be defined
# "virtual" tag indicates that this channel is not a physical channel
#   but is generated dynamically onboard
